# Data camp (M2 Data Science 2022/2023)

The purpose of this challenge was to classify cell-types with single-cell RNAseq count data :

- A guide is available in the jupyter notebook `scMARK_classification_starting_kit.ipynb`
- The data can be downloaded via the python script `download_data.py` (also available in the folder `/data`)
- The submission files are accessible in the folder `/submissions`
- To better understand our approach, please refer to `preprocess.ipynb`, `model.ipynb` or the `/docs` folder
